FizzBuzz
========

FizzBuzz.exe is a console application that takes two integer arguments and optionally, an additional two string arguments. If the string arguments are not added then the default "Fizz" and "Buzz" will be used.

I assumed that "5. Your FizzBuzz library should be able to generate output to a destination other than the console." meant that the program should print to a collection of some sort so it could be used in another way besides just printing to the console.
